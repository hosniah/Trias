trias-algorithm
===============

An algorithm for computing triadic concepts which fulfill minimal support constraints. 

Trias was first described in 
[this paper](http://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/2797d40e05a48f4343d7695dac87b5870/jaeschke), more details can be found in the paper 

[Discovering Shared Conceptualizations in Folksonomies](http://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/218e8babe208fae2c0342438617b0ec31/jaeschke).

compiling
---------

You need git, Java and Maven2 to download and compile the code. Then
you can do:

git clone git://github.com/rjoberon/bibsonomy-tools.git
cd bibsonomy-tools
mvn install 
```
You can find the compiled JAR file in the `target` folder.

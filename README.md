This is a first step in order to produce Triadic Associsation Rules used as input for a dynamic replication strategy for DataGrid.
The following implementation aims to generates Generic Basis of Triadic Rules (BGRT) based on previous works related to folksonomies.
The 3 dimensions of our replication problem are Grid tasks, Gris Files, and Grid Sites.


Used algorithms:

ARTMINER for Generic basis extraction:
===============
ARTMiner was first described in ["BGRT: une nouvelle base générique de règles d'association triadiques. Application à l'autocomplétion de requêtes dans les folksonomies] ().
" Chiraz Trabelsi, Nader Jelassi, Sadok Ben Yahia.

TRIIAS:
===============

An algorithm for computing triadic concepts which fulfill minimal support constraints. 

Trias was first described in [this paper](http://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/2797d40e05a48f4343d7695dac87b5870/jaeschke), more details can be found in the paper
